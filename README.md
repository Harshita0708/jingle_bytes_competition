To develop a Python-based project for Forecasting Holiday Weather Impact, we can begin by building a pipeline using the dataset. I’ll write the code in these steps.
Steps:
1.	Load the Dataset.
2.	Data Preprocessing.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
4.	Feature Engineering (include holiday information).
5.	Model Building (time series or regression).
6.	Evaluation and Visualization.
Let's get started! I'll first load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains 675 entries with the following notable columns:
1.	DATE: Date of the observation (important for time-series analysis).
2.	PRCP: Precipitation data (missing for most entries).
3.	TAVG: Average temperature (complete).
4.	TMAX: Maximum temperature (some missing values).
5.	TMIN: Minimum temperature (some missing values).
   
Additional information includes the station name, location (latitude, longitude), and attributes for certain weather metrics
Next Steps:
1.	Preprocess the Data:
o	Convert DATE to a datetime format.
o	Handle missing values in PRCP, TMAX, and TMIN.
2.	Add Holiday Information:
o	Tag holidays (e.g., New Year, Christmas) for analysis.
3.	EDA:
o	Visualize temperature and precipitation trends.
4.	Build a Forecasting Model.
Let’s begin with preprocessing the data and adding holiday markers. 
Preprocessing Complete:
•	DATE is now in datetime format.
•	Missing values in:
o	PRCP (precipitation) filled with 0 (assumes no rain).
o	TMAX and TMIN (temperature) filled with the mean values.
•	HOLIDAY column added, marking New Year (01-01) as a holiday.

Next Steps:
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Visualize trends for temperature and precipitation during holidays vs. non-holidays.
2.	Feature Engineering:
o	Create rolling averages for temperature and precipitation.
3.	Forecasting Model:
o	Use regression or time-series forecasting (e.g., SARIMA, Prophet).

There are some meaningful plots using your weather_data DataFrame:
1.	Temperature Trends Over Time:

weather_data.plot(x='DATE', y='TAVG', title='Average Temperature Over Time', xlabel='Date', ylabel='Temperature (°C)')
2.	Holiday vs. Non-Holiday Temperature:
o	A boxplot to compare temperatures for holidays and non-holidays:

import seaborn as sns
sns.boxplot(data=weather_data, x='HOLIDAY', y='TAVG').set_title('Temperature Distribution: Holidays vs. Non-Holidays')
3.	Precipitation on Holidays:
o	A bar plot of precipitation grouped by holiday vs. non-holiday:

sns.barplot(data=weather_data, x='HOLIDAY', y='PRCP').set_title('Precipitation: Holidays vs. Non-Holidays')
4.	Scatter Plot of Temperature vs. Precipitation:
o	To see the relationship between temperature and precipitation:

weather_data.plot.scatter(x='TAVG', y='PRCP', title='Temperature vs Precipitation')
5.	Rolling Average of Temperature:
o	Plot a rolling average for smoother trends:

weather_data['Rolling_TAVG'] = weather_data['TAVG'].rolling(window=7).mean()
weather_data.plot(x='DATE', y='Rolling_TAVG', title='7-Day Rolling Average Temperature')
